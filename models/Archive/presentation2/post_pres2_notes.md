# Post Presentation 2 Notes
24 Mar 2020

## Considerations
- More images for re-occurring concepts to anchor the concepts (which I can design/draw)
- F# could be a code-base to look at, since it is used by the author of the PM textbook (abdo should look into this code-base as well as maybe if there are examples of his work online)
- Next presentation in 2 weeks, I will be working on algorithms and working with the event log data, if I need help with pre-processing the data I will reach out. Otherwise sit tight!

So far so good
