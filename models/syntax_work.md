# Collaborative Speech Act Modeling

## Objective
The objective this week is to solidify and find some way to reason about and define the syntax of the model, such that we can then apply this logic.

### Resources
* Coding Scheme (Documentation provided by Sunny, regarding the coding scheme they use to talk about the collaborative acts)
* Collaborative Data (Excel file format data on the collaborative acts)
* Linear Temporal Logic (The baseline logic that we think works well to reason about collaborative speech acts)
* Process Mining (Textbook on Process Mining)
