## Softmax
1. Clearly redefine the softmax function:
softmax(X) = exp(x<sub>i</sub>)/\sum_{k=1}^{n}exp(x<sub>i</sub>)
where X = {x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ... , x<sub>n</sub>}
2. Show that the softmax is invariant to constant offsets.
(show that using logs, products because addition, and division becomes subtraction,
  and that because the sum sums over everything, the constant essentially doesn't alter
  the results of the softmax function)
3. Please see code.
