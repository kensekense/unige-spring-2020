Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements - at times eclectic , drawing upon various sources , and syncretic , combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches .
anarkizm haz continued to jeneraet meny filausefees and moovments - at tiems eklektik , drawing upon vaerius sorses , and sinkretik , combiening disperet conseps to creeaet nue filesaufikal aproeches .
The anti - capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents .
th entee - capitalist tradishon of clasikal anarkizm haz rimaend prauminent within contemporary curents .
Various anarchist groups , tendencies and schools of thought exist today , making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement .
vaerius anarkist groops , tendensees and skools of thaut exist toodai , maiking it difikult to diskrieb contemporary anarkist moovment .
While theorists and activists have established " relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles " , there is no consensus on which principles are core .
whiel theerists and aktivists hav established " relativly staebl constulaeshons of anarkist prinsipls " , ther is no consensuus on which prinsipls are koor .
As a result , commentators describe multiple " anarchisms " ( rather than a singular " anarchism " ) in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently .
as a result , comentaeters diskrieb multipl " anarkizms " ( rather than a singueler " anarkizm " ) in which caumen prinsipls are shaerd bitween skools of anarkizm whiel eech groop prieoritiezes thoz prinsipls difrently .
For example , gender equality can be a common principle but ranks as a higher priority to anarcha - feminists than anarchist communists .
foer exampl , jender ikoowality can be a caumen prinsipl but ranks as a hieur prieority to anarka - feminists than anarkist comuenists  .
Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in the following forms , namely " all centralized and hierarchical forms of government ( e.g . , monarchy , representative democracy , state socialism , etc . ) , economic class systems ( e.g . , capitalism , Bolshevism , feudalism , slavery , etc . ) , autocratic religions ( e.g . , fundamentalist Islam , Roman Catholicism , etc . ) , patriarchy , heterosexism , white supremacy , and imperialism " .
anarkists are jeneraly comited agenst coersiv authoerity in the faloeing foerms , naimly " all senchruulizd and hierarkikal  foerms of guvernment ( e.g . , monarky , reprisentativ dimokrasy , stait soeshalizm  , etc . ) , ekonomik clas sistems ( e.g . , capitalizm , boelshevizm , fuedalizm , slaivury , etc . ) , autoekratik rilijuns ( e.g . , fundamentalist izlam , roemen cathaulisizm , etc . ) , paitreearky , heteroeseksizm , whyt soopremesy , and impeereeuulizm " .
However , anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed .
however , anarkist skools disagree on th methids by which thees foerms shuld be opoest .
Tactics .
taktiks .
Anarchists ' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals - first , to oppose the Establishment ; and second , to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society , illustrating the unity of means and ends .
anarkists ' taktiks taek vaerius foerms but in jeneral serv too maejer goels - ferst , to opoez th establishment ; and sekend , to promoet anarkist ethiks and reflekt an anarkist vizhon of sosiety , ilustrating th uenity of meens and ends .
A broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means , and aims to change society through evolutionary means .
a braud categeriezaeshon can be maed bitween aims to disjroi opresiv staets and institooshons by revolooshonaery meens , and aims to chaenj sosiety thru evolooshonaery meens .
Evolutionary tactics reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims , though there is significant overlap between the two .
evolooshonaery taktiks rejekt vielens and taek a grajual aproech to anarkist aims , tho there is significant oeverlap bitween th too .
Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century .
anarkist taktiks hav shiftid during th koors of th last senchury .
Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy , while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches .
anarkists during th erly 20th senchury foekusd moor on strieks and militensy , whiel contemporary anarkists uez a bauder arae of aproeches .
Classical era tactics .
clasikal era taktiks .
During the classical era , anarchists had a militant tendency .
during th clasikal era , anarkists had a militent tendensy .
Not only did they confront state armed forces ( as in Spain and Ukraine ) but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed .
not oenly did thae confront staet armd forses ( as in spaen and ukraen ) but sum of them alsoe emploid terorizm  as propaganda of the deed .
Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state , some of which were successful .
asasinaeshon etemps wur careed out agenst heds of staet , sum of which wer suksesful .
Anarchists also took part in revolutions .
anarkists alsoe tuk part in revolooshons .
Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial .
anarkist purspektivs toewerds vielens hav alwaes bin purpleksing and contruvershal .
On one hand , anarcho - pacifists point out the unity of means and ends .
on wun hand , anarkoe - pasifists point out th uenity of meens and ends .
On the other hand , other anarchist groups advocate direct action , a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or even acts of terrorism .
on th other hand , other anarkist groops advoekaet dierekt akshon , a taktik which can inklood akts of sabotazh or eevin akts of terorizm  .
This attitude was quite prominent a century ago ; seeing the state as a tyrant , some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible .
this atitood waz quite prominent a senchury agoe ; seeng th staet az a tierent , sum anarkists buleevd that thae had evree riet to opoez its opreshon by eny meens posibl .
Emma Goldman and Errico Malatesta , who were proponents of limited use of violence , argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil .
ema goeldman and erikoe malastesta , hoo wur propoenents of limited yoos of vilens , argued that vilens is meerly a reakshon to staet violens as a nesesaery eevil .
Anarchists took an active role in strikes , although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism , seeing it as reformist .
anarkists tuk an aktiv roel in strieks , althoe thae tendid to be anteeputhetik to foermul sindikalizm , seeng it as riformist .
They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism .
thae saw it as a part of th moovment which sawt to ovurthroe th staet and capitalizm .
