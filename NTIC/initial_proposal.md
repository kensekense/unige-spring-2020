"Création d’une interface web pour l'enrichissement d'un dictionnaire multilingue, E. Wehrli et L. Nerima, LATL"

## Things we are responsible for
- The project itself
- Report regarding the project
- Presentation (powerpoint and speaking)

## Important Dates (tentative)
###### 13 March: "Validation of use cases"
Not sure what this means yet, we should contact Haozhou for a meeting sometime next week

###### 22 May: "Presentation of Projects"
Tentative time, but this should be considered the deadline for the project. We will have reports and check-ins throughout the semester presumably that will be communicated to us.
