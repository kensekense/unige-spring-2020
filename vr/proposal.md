# Quantum Map - 3D puzzle game

## Proposal
"The observer effect is the theory that mere observation of a phenomenon inevitably changes that phenomenon."

The game will be a 3D, first-person puzzle game, where the objective will be to reach the exit room at each stage. The goal will be accessible only after the player "solves" the puzzle, which is part of every stage (level). The player will have access to a "map" of the level, which will give some information regarding the stage. The player's eyes will be tracked during the game, and depending on what they "observe," different elements of the stage and the map will be altered accordingly. Be very careful what you choose to observe, as it could quite literally change your fate!
